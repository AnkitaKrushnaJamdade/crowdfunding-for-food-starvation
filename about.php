            <h1>About HungerJustice!!</h1>
                <p>As the year 2030 draws closer, achievement of the world's commitment to Zero Hunger is tragically
                    distant. Current projections based on the Global Hunger Index (GHI) show that the
                    world as a whole and 47 countries in particular will fail to achieve even low hunger by 2030.</p>

                <p>Around 811 million people go to bed hungry every night, and nearly half of all child deaths worldwide
                    are linked to malnutrition.
                    Many young children never get a chance to live beyond the age of five - even though we can predict,
                    prevent, and treat malnutrition.</p>

                <p><strong>Hunger Justice</strong> allows people from across the globe to raise funds for the food starvation all over
                    the world. We fights with the global hunger as it enables users to make small donations to specific
                    countries.</p>

                <p><strong>Hunger Justice</strong> has been working towards ending hunger. We believe in a world where everyone,
                    worldwide, receives sufficient food.</p>

                <p>#NoOneHungry is remarkable place! Let's take 1st move!</p>
